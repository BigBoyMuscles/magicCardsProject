# magicCardsProject
A app that will play a simple card game with the user.

### How It Works
User is presented with three columns of seven cards each, and is asked to choose a card an remember it. The user tells the app which column their chosen ared is in, and then the cards are shuffled and redistributed. The player repeats this process two more times, and then the app guesses which card the user originally chose.
